# Hello And Welcome

This is a collection of things missing from the interwebs and probably some duplicates.

## EmbedIO

First off I've been trying to use [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio) but they have no getting started tutorial. Add to that the code samples in their project page are code snippets, so don't compile and run without finding more code from their samples directory, the learning curve is quite steep.

I decided to write some simple getting started tutorials to document my learning:

1. [Hello from EmbedIO](./embedio/part1.html)

# Who am I and what's with the name

I'm Dave, from Gods Own County of Yorkshire in the UK. I started my working life as a Draftsman but went to university as a mature student and got a BSc in Computer Science. I'm now a programmer/software developer. I'm married and have a daughter, dog amd cat who all ignore me, unless they want something :)

My user name is taken from [Gustavus Katterfelto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Katterfelto) who was a Prussian conjurer, scientific lecturer, and quack; he is buried in a local Church.
